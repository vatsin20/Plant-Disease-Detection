🚀 Just Launched: AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection Web App! 🌿📱

I’m excited to share my latest project — a deep learning-based web application that detects plant leaf diseases using just a photo!

🔍 What it does:

Uses MobileNetV2 trained on 50,000+ images from the PlantVillage dataset

Supports live camera input or image upload

Predicts plant disease with high accuracy — all from your browser!

No installation needed ✅

🛠️ Built With:

Python + TensorFlow

Streamlit (for the interactive web interface)

Trained and deployed completely by me 💪

🌐 Try it out online:

This project was built to support farmers, students, and researchers who want a quick and accessible way to detect crop health — from anywhere.

Would love your thoughts, feedback, or collaboration ideas!
